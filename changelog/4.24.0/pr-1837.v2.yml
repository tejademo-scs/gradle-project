    Increase the speed of the `checkClassUniqueness` task, especially in large repos, by adding caching of jar information.

    Fix class names listed in the `baseline-class-uniqueness.lock` when the class or package name contains the substring `class`. In rare cases, this may require running `./gradlew checkClassUniqueness --write-locks` to update the files.
