    Add an errorprone check and typed annotation for Javax -> Jakarta

    There is a certain class of very problematic cases whereby if you have
    a method such as the following:

    ```
    myJerseyResource.register(/* this is of type Object */ object);
    ```

    Then if you supply a resource which includes any `javax.ws.rs`
    annotations on it, then those will not be registered if your Jersey
    version is 3.x or later (and you'll only find this out at runtime).

    The opposite is also true if you try to supply resources annotated
    with `jakarta.ws.rs` to Jersey 2.x.

    To address this, this commit attempts to add an errorprone check
    which lets implementors add an annotation `@ForbidJavax` to methods
    which have been knowingly migrated to Jakarta EE9 and cannot
    accept legacy javax types.
